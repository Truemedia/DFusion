HELP_HEADER=JFusion Installation Help
HELP_WARNING=THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE PLUGIN -> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
HELP_ABOUT=Welcome to the JFusion plugin for Joomla. With this plugin you can integrate Joomla and many other softwares without making any changes to the core files, as all integration is done using Joomla plugins. This means that you can use the powerful Content Management Software (CMS) Joomla and have it all seamlessly integrated with other specialized software. Since JFusion utilizes the new Joomla plugin features, it only works with Joomla 1.5.x, not with Joomla 1.0.x.
HELP_ABOUT2=This plugin will make the forum software database the "master database" for any Joomla authentication. This means that your forum software will be used for all usermanagament such as registration, lost password, permissions, etc. Therefore you will need to disable user registration in the Joomla global configuration screen. JFusion has a login module included, in order for your users to be automatically redirected to the appropriate forum pages for user registration and lost password.
HELP_INSTALL=We spent quite a bit of time making the installation process as easy as possible. There is extensive error checking and reporting during all steps of installation to make it easy for you to see what you need to do.
HELP_INSTALL_DETAIL=Please visit the website http://www.jfusion.org for detailed installation instructions.
HELP_ADV=What are the advantages of the JFusion integration?
HELP_ADV_DETAIL=<ul><li>Just install the plugin, configure and publish the plugin to get up and running</li> <li>No changes to the Joomla core, no manual uploading of files, and no synchronization issues between tables.</li> <li>Softwares can be installed on the same server as Joomla or on a remote server</li> <li>JFusion will generate cookies for both softwares on sign-in</li> <li>No nasty synchronisation issues, as a single table is used for authentication.</li></ul>
HELP_FEEDBACK=Can JFusion do ......... or I am having problems with ..............
HELP_FEEDBACK_DETAIL=We love to hear feedback on this plugin. Please visit the JFusion support forums to leave feedback (http://www.jfusion.org/phpbb3) We also welcome any coding development you can offer. Get involved with JFusion and help to expand the set of features/implementations.
WRAPPER_HEADER=How to use the component as a forum wrapper
WRAPPER_TEXT=You can access any page on your forum with a Joomla link to the component. Simple include the variable 'wrap=forumfile.php' in the url and the component will create a wrapper that displays that page. The wrapper automatically grabs the URL to your forum software, therefore you do not need to include the full URL in the wrap variable. Here is an example of how to make a joomla link to the registration page:<br><br> http://www.yourjoomlurl.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&wrap=register.php <br><br><br>We would love your help in creating a mod for the forum software, that would force the forum to always use joomla urls. An example of this implementation can be found on: http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=81152.msg541379#msg541379 <br><br>Get involved and help develop JFusion. Thanks!
