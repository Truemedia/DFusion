HELP_ACTION_TEXT=JFusion uses the Joomla 1.5 framework to provide user integration without any core hacks. JFusion only works with Joomla 1.5.x and not with Joomla 1.0.x. You can select which software is used as the master of authentication and which are used as Slaves. All user registrations and password changes will need to be made through the master software. JFusion will update the software slaves with the user details from the master user table. In addition JFusion can handle multiple types of password encryption and can even create a session in the slave softwares to automatically log the user into all softwares.
HELP_ACTION=How does JFusion work?
HELP_BUGS_TEXT=JFusion is an BETA release and we would love to hear from you on how we can make JFusion work better. If you find any bugs or issues please report them on the following <a href="http://code.jfusion.org/projects/show/develop">Website</a>.
