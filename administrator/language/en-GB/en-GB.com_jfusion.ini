HELP_CAN_DO=What can JFusion do?
HELP_CANT_DO=What can JFusion not do?
HELP_CAN_DO_1=JFusion allows you to integrate your Joomla users with many other softwares, therefore allowing your users to register only once and then login with a single username/password across different online softwares.
HELP_CAN_DO_2=Additional modules are provided to show avatars from your integrated software on the login module and to shoe forum posts in Joomla itself.
HELP_CANT_DO_1=JFusion does not make any changes to the integrated software, therefore if you login through your integrated software, you will not be logged into Joomla.
HELP_CANT_DO_2=JFusion is an alpha release, intended to get feedback from the Joomla community. JFusion should not be used on production sites at this stage.
HELP_ACTION=How does JFusion work?
HELP_ACTION_TEXT=JFusion uses the Joomla 1.5 framework to provide user integration without any core hacks. Jfusion only works with Joomla 1.5.x and not with Joomla 1.0.x. You can select which software is used as the master of authentication. All user registration and password changes will need to be made through the master software. Jfusion will update the software slaves with the user details from the master user table. In addition Jfusion can handle multiple types of password encryption and can even create a session in the slave softwares to automatically logon the user on all softwares.
HELP_INSTALL=How to install and configure JFusion:
