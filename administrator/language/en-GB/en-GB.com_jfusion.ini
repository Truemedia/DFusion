HELP_HEADER=JFusion Installation Help
HELP_WARNING=THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE PLUGIN -> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
HELP_CAN_DO=What can JFusion do?
HELP_CANT_DO=What can JFusion not do?
HELP_CAN_DO_1=JFusion allows you to integrate your Joomla users with many other softwares, therefore allowing your users to register only once and then login with a single username/password across different online softwares.
HELP_CAN_DO_2=Additional modules are provided to show avatars from your integrated software on the login module and to show forum posts in Joomla itself.
HELP_CANT_DO_1=JFusion does not make any changes to the integrated software, therefore if you login through your integrated software, you will not be logged into Joomla.
HELP_CANT_DO_2=JFusion is an alpha release, intended to get feedback from the Joomla community. JFusion should not be used on production sites at this stage.
HELP_ACTION=How does JFusion work?
HELP_ACTION_TEXT=JFusion uses the Joomla 1.5 framework to provide user integration without any core hacks. JFusion only works with Joomla 1.5.x and not with Joomla 1.0.x. You can select which software is used as the master of authentication. All user registrations and password changes will need to be made through the master software. JFusion will update the software slaves with the user details from the master user table. In addition JFusion can handle multiple types of password encryption and can even create a session in the slave softwares to automatically log the user into all softwares.
HELP_INSTALL=How to install and configure JFusion:
HELP_INSTALL_TEXT=We spent quite a bit of time making the installation process as easy as possible. There is a setup wizard and extensive error checking during all steps of installation to make it easy for yourself. Please installation and configure JFusion using the steps below:
HELP_INSTALL_1=Install the JFusion component
HELP_INSTALL_2=Configure the JFusion plugins and select your master/slaves
HELP_INSTALL_3=Run the usersync in the JFusion component to synchronize the user tables
HELP_INSTALL_4=Run the login checker to confirm the login behaviour is correct

HELP_INSTALL_6=Disable the Joomla default autentication and user plugins
HELP_INSTALL_7=Install and configure the JFusion login and activity module (optional)
HELP_VISUAL=Visual Integration:

HELP_VISUAL_1=modify your external softwares template to match Joomla and select the 'direct link' option in the JFusion login / activity module.
HELP_VISUAL_2=Show the external software in a Joomla iframe wrapper and select the 'wrapper' option in the JFusion login / activity module. You can create a menu link to your software by creating a new Joomla menu item for the JFusion component.
